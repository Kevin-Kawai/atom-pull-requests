# TODO

- [x] work with private or enterprise repositories (see package settings)
- [ ] render all MarkDown in the comments
- [ ] support forked Pull Requests
- [ ] do local diff of all commits since the one pushed to GitHub
- [ ] support comments made to the entire Pull Request (not just lines in the code)

# Atom API Suggestions

- expose a `tree-view` file decorator that can add classes asynchronously
- provide icons in gutter markers
